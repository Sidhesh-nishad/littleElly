I try to manage 2 kids at home and I know how difficult it is. So, hats-off to everyone, to have made the event start in time 2. Discipline: I expected kids to run around and sit with their parents after seeing them, as the event was going through. But, all the kids sat in their places till the very end (except for very little ones). It is great to see the teachers to have inculcated such a discipline, at this age. 3.
