                    “Hi all, My daughter Deeksha  is in UKG. Our experience with “Little Elly” AECS has been joyous from day 1. I’ve had the joy of watching my daughter Deeksha transform from a shy kid to a communicative, curious, cheerful and studious girl. She has learnt a lot in these 3 years apart from having fun and making friends. She is one girl who doesn't sit and study all the time , but still due to the teachers' continuous efforts and revisions she is strong in her academic basics. Her admission process to Grade 1 was hence easy for us. She has been doing well in studies and a number of extra curricular activities. The teachers have been so kind and caring she has always loved to go to school. While I am typing this post Deeksha wants to know if SHE CAN STUDY IN “LITTLE ELLY” FOREVER. That summarizes it all. THANKS A LOT TEAM “LITTLE ELLY”.  And my special thanks to Vrushali, Smitha, Divya , Ruchi and Shailaja ma’am. All of you have done a lot to help our kids learn and evolve. Grateful for eveything”.

                  It is the aim of all parents to find the right school for their child, preferably a home away from home, one that takes care of the child’s learning and also equips them with life skills in their overall development. We at “Little Elly” Arekere strongly believe in what Bill Gates once famously said, “The first five years have so much to do with how the next 80 turn out.” Research shows that the first five years of childhood are the most formative and incredible learning with vital mental and cognitive development occurs during this period. The role and importance of early childhood education in shaping our lives cannot be understated.\n Beyond the A, B, C and rhymes, this phase is equally important for the all-round development of the child. Our programs are tailor-made to foster every child’s emotional, intellectual and aesthetic quotient. Started in 2008, “Little Elly” Arekere has been one of the best preschools in this locality and the distinguishing feature which sets us apart is our staff, who have been associated with us for more than a decade. We nurture warm relationships among Children, Teachers, Staff and Parents. Teachers and staff build a close rapport with each and every child under their wing.

Punctuality: With so many kids and less teachers to manage, it was surprisingly nice to see the event start in time, without much fuss. Kudos to the organizers and all teachers. I try to manage 2 kids at home and I know how difficult it is. So, hats-off to everyone, to have made the event start in time 2. Discipline: I expected kids to run around and sit with their parents after seeing them, as the event was going through. But, all the kids sat in their places till the very end (except for very little ones). It is great to see the teachers to have inculcated such a discipline, at this age. 3. Opportunity for every kid: I noticed that all the kids got the opportunity to perform in at least one event and one sport. I was happy to see my kid coming home and eagerly and happily explaining to me the events and sports they practiced at school. Great job”.

                  It is the aim of every parent to find the right school for their child, preferably a home away from home, one that takes care of the child’s learning, equips them with life skills as well as helps them in their overall development. We at “Little Elly” Arekere strongly believe in what Bill Gates once famously said, “The first five years have so much to do with how the next 80 turn out.” Research shows that the first five years of childhood are the most formative and incredible learning period during which vital mental and cognitive development occurs.\nThe role and importance of early childhood education in shaping our lives cannot be understated. Beyond the ABCD and rhymes this phase is equally important for the all-round development of the child. Our programs are tailor-made to foster every child’s emotional, intellectual and aesthetic quotient. Started in 2008, “Little Elly” Arekere has been one of the best preschools in this locality and the distinguishing feature which sets us apart is our staff, who have been associated with us for more than a decade. We nurture warm relationships among Children, Teachers, Staff and Parents. Teachers and staff build a close personal connection with each child in their care.

                    I’m glad to say that my son Taher khandwawala has graduated from “Little Elly” Nobonagar branch successfully this year with help of his teachers Kavita and Sreedevi .This year was the most difficult part as it was online and the kids were too young to understand, but with help of his teacher he has done it successfully. I’m very happy with Mrs Kavita and Mrs Sreedevi’s way of handling children in class as they were too young. Both were very cooperative, very regularly conducting classes and focused on each and every child and they made the class attractive too. My son used to eagerly wait for the session everyday. 
                    Thank you so much teachers for your kind support through this difficult time.

                    Vishan has immensely benefited with the warm environment school provided to him . The space given to him for settling down right from the first day (which he required) really helped him feel comfortable and perform to the best of his abilities . He as a student and we as parents would like to thank each one who is associated with making his journey so memorable. We wish the school good luck for the future years .We would like to share our experience .Below is the same .  Our child has been with ”Little Elly” - Nobo Nagar branch for 2.5 years , from Nursery to Ukg . Our experience with the school has been wonderful. The school management and staff were very warm , experienced and meticulous. They provided the necessary space and encouragement required for the child to grow . The curriculum and related books were excellent . School conducted a lot of extra curricular activities which kept our child motivated. Our child, although an introvert was encouraged at every step. “Little Elly” has laid a great foundation stone in our child’s educational career for which we are thankful to one and all.

                     I would like to express my gratitude towards all the teachers for the idea of online classes for the  little ones. Initially we were worried how the small children would cope with it,  as it was a new concept; but I want to thank you for connecting our children to E- learning. All the sessions were very well planned and executed. Thanks a lot to Sridevi ma'am and Kavitha ma'am for all their hard work and interest. Children really enjoyed all the dance, story and drawing sessions as they were fun filled. The sessions were very interactive, informative and very interesting.
                     A big thank you to the “Little Elly” team and waiting to experience an another amazing year.

                    My daughter Yashika Nigam has been associated with “Little Elly” from her Nursery class. We found the school and the teaching methodology just amazing  Kavitha ma'am is very innovative and I really appreciate her patience with the students. She is very humble and can be reached at any point of time. She is fun loving and manages the class very well. Kids are happy talking to her and she listens to all kids with great enthusiasm. She encourages kids and motivates them to complete all assignments on time. Her approach is easy and kids co-relate with her very well. I wish Kavitha ma'am all the best for the future. Keep up the good work.
                    A proud and blessed parent to be a part of the “Little Elly” family.

                  My name is Rinku Jha and I am a teacher and an artist. I have extensive experience in teaching and was a part of the Kumarans school for more than 15 years. I have also been running supplementary education and hobby classes for K12 students for more than a decade.\nIn my experience I have learnt that the earlier a holistic approach to a child’s education is undertaken, the better the results.Because of this and my varied experience of providing all round development to kids, I am now excited to partner with Little Elly to provide top notch education to pre nursery kids. I am sure that with my passion and experience along with Little Elly’s expertise, we will deliver the best for our kids.

Due to some problem, my son didn’t study Nursery. He was directly admitted to LKG. He didn't know to even write letter A. Surprisingly, he scored out of out in all the subjects at final exams!!! I am really very happy with the positive changes. Parents, it’s a right place to shape your kids carrier… I wish "Little Elly" to grow, get more success and brighten the kids future.

                    It was our first time enrolling our daughter in preschool so we were nervous at first but Mrs Krupa and the rest of the staff at “Little Elly”, Perambur  are so incredible that they soon made us feel comfortable. Our daughter is excited every morning about going to school and in fact refuses to come back home. Tanu had been to the school only for a week and two days but I could still see some changes in her behaviour, this shows the personal attention she receives and how they have cultivated good behaviour in other kids as well. We highly recommend this school.

Have always liked little children around me apart from being curious observers of various interesting stages through which they grow. Have realized that to be a good teacher, one has to be a keen observer. Association with this field has taught me things like patience, listening skills and human relations.

                  My name is Debjani and I come with an experience of over 13 years in pre-primary education. I am also a skilled Indian Classical dancer with a number of stage performances to my credit. I’ve always felt driven to be a pre-primary school educator and it gives me a great sense of pride to be able to facilitate the growth and development of young children. I am extremely passionate and continuously look forward to honing my teaching skills as I work with young minds at school. It is this passion and enthusiasm that has motivated me to build my own set up at Little Elly Wagholi. Through this new setup of ours, I will strive to bring out the best of my experience and abilities and be able to act as a guiding light for the little ones.

                  Every child should be educated, happy and most importantly loved. Jyoti has always felt very strongly about that. While working out of India she assisted in schools whenever she had some time free from her actual job and that is where her passion for teaching in a fun way came about.\nMaking sure that every child is learning, happy and safe in the preschool space is of utmost importance to her. She believes Little Elly provides all of that and more.
