I’ve had the joy of watching my daughter Deeksha transform from a shy kid to a communicative, curious, cheerful and studious girl. She has learnt a lot in these 3 years apart from having fun and making friends. She is one girl who doesn't sit and study all the time , but still due to the teachers' continuous efforts and revisions she is strong in her academic basics. Her admission process to Grade 1 was hence easy for us. She has been doing well in studies and a number of extra curricular activities. The teachers have been so kind and caring she has always loved to go to school. While I am typing this post Deeksha wants to know if SHE CAN STUDY IN “LITTLE ELLY” FOREVER. That summarizes it all. THANKS A LOT TEAM “LITTLE ELLY”.  And my special thanks to Vrushali, Smitha, Divya , Ruchi and Shailaja ma’am. All of you have done a lot to help our kids learn and evolve. Grateful for eveything”.

                description: |-
                  It is the aim of all parents to find the right school for their child, preferably a home away from home, one that takes care of the child’s learning and also equips them with life skills in their overall development. We at “Little Elly” Arekere strongly believe in what Bill Gates once famously said, “The first five years have so much to do with how the next 80 turn out.” Research shows that the first five years of childhood are the most formative and incredible learning with vital mental and cognitive development occurs during this period. The role and importance of early childhood education in shaping our lives cannot be understated.

                   Beyond the A, B, C and rhymes, this phase is equally important for the all-round development of the child. Our programs are tailor-made to foster every child’s emotional, intellectual and aesthetic quotient. Started in 2008, “Little Elly” Arekere has been one of the best preschools in this locality and the distinguishing feature which sets us apart is our staff, who have been associated with us for more than a decade. We nurture warm relationships among Children, Teachers, Staff and Parents. Teachers and staff build a close rapport with each and every child under their wing.

                  At our Little Elly Basaveshwarnagar, our primary focus is the regular practice of the fundamental Montessori principles of respect, freedom and consistency. Self-esteem is connected to the confidence and motivation that children need to achieve their academic goals.

                  Our aim is to preserve these traits in our children as they continue to move through all cycles of development. We have, and we will continue to provide a safe and supportive environment as well as teaching and learning programs that meet the needs of all our children.

I wish to provide some feedback about the Sports Day event conducted by the school. 1. Punctuality: With so many kids and less teachers to manage, it was surprisingly nice to see the event start in time, without much fuss. Kudos to the organizers and all teachers. I try to manage 2 kids at home and I know how difficult it is. So, hats-off to everyone, to have made the event start in time 2. Discipline: I expected kids to run around and sit with their parents after seeing them, as the event was going through. But, all the kids sat in their places till the very end (except for very little ones). It is great to see the teachers to have inculcated such a discipline, at this age. 3. Opportunity for every kid: I noticed that all the kids got the opportunity to perform in at least one event and one sport. I was happy to see my kid coming home and eagerly and happily explaining to me the events and sports they practiced at school. Great job”.'

We really had a very good experience and my son is very happy.

                  It is the aim of every parent to find the right school for their child, preferably a home away from home, one that takes care of the child’s learning, equips them with life skills as well as helps them in their overall development. We at “Little Elly” Arekere strongly believe in what Bill Gates once famously said, “The first five years have so much to do with how the next 80 turn out.” Research shows that the first five years of childhood are the most formative and incredible learning period during which vital mental and cognitive development occurs.

                  The role and importance of early childhood education in shaping our lives cannot be understated. Beyond the ABCD and rhymes this phase is equally important for the all-round development of the child. Our programs are tailor-made to foster every child’s emotional, intellectual and aesthetic quotient. Started in 2008, “Little Elly” Arekere has been one of the best preschools in this locality and the distinguishing feature which sets us apart is our staff, who have been associated with us for more than a decade. We nurture warm relationships among Children, Teachers, Staff and Parents. Teachers and staff build a close personal connection with each child in their care.

I’m very happy with Mrs Kavita and Mrs Sreedevi’s way of handling children in class as they were too young. Both were very cooperative, very regularly conducting classes and focused on each and every child and they made the class attractive too. My son used to eagerly wait for the session everyday.

                  I'm a B.E graduate. My passion and love for kids to build a bright future made me give up my IT profession. 

                  I feel fun-activity based learning is one of the best ways to teach our little ones in a safe learning environment where there is equal opportunity for all, so that the kids get pro-actively perfect on what they are learning.

                  I also believe that Every kid is a one-of-a-kind superstar by unleashing their inner awesomeness and helping them shine.

Her penchant for mentoring young children in the family in their school projects and co-curricular activities motivated her to explore the talent further. The much needed push in the educational field came through her tie up with schools for International speech and drama classes.

In such a challenging scenario, Hajira was determined to set up the preschool. This is when she decided on going for a franchise with Little Elly.

                description: Mrs Krupashankari, who heads the Perambur center in Chennai, is a commerce graduate, strong in academics and an enthusiast in sports cum extra-curricular activities. She started her career in a global bank and in parallel honed her skills towards coaching kids as she felt “one of the ways to serve the society can be done through grooming the young minds” – not only through imparting knowledge but also educating them on the values, ethos, discipline and respect to others. She got herself certified in Montessori and early childhood education and post which worked as a Kindergarten Teacher in a reputed school before pursuing her dream to lead a pre-school as Director and decided to ensue through the franchisee model with most reputed pre-school chain Little Elly.

Our daughter is excited every morning about going to school and in fact refuses to come back home. Tanu had been to the school only for a week and two days but I could still see some changes in her behaviour, this shows the personal attention she receives and how they have cultivated good behaviour in other kids as well. We highly recommend this school.

                description: I have been involved with early childcare and education for more than 10 years, a bulk of which has been with this lovely organization, Little Elly. Have always liked little children around me apart from being curious observers of various interesting stages through which they grow. Have realized that to be a good teacher, one has to be a keen observer. Association with this field has taught me things like patience, listening skills and human relations.

I am also a skilled Indian Classical dancer with a number of stage performances to my credit. I’ve always felt driven to be a pre-primary school educator and it gives me a great sense of pride to be able to facilitate the growth and development of young children. I am extremely passionate and continuously look forward to honing my teaching skills as I work with young minds at school. It is this passion and enthusiasm that has motivated me to build my own set up at Little Elly Wagholi. Through this new setup of ours, I will strive to bring out the best of my experience and abilities and be able to act as a guiding light for the little ones.

While working out of India she assisted in schools whenever she had some time free from her actual job and that is where her passion for teaching in a fun way came about.

                  Making sure that every child is learning, happy and safe in the preschool space is of utmost importance to her. She believes Little Elly provides all of that and more.
